## Our Goal
Our goal is to develop a network digital twin that integrates the digital twin, simulation, and AI/ML technologies to automatically optimize the operation of a network at any time.

## Our Work
* **Research:** Proposing cutting-edge algorithms, protocols, and system design and implementation for network optimization.
* **Development:** Developing open-source framework, applications, tools, and kernel for the network digital twin community.
* **Test:** Testing NDTwin rigorously to ensure its high quality, performance, and reliability before releasing it to the community.
