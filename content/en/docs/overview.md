## Features

* **Create a network digital twin that is faithful to the physical network at any time**: NDTwin updates its perceived network topology whenever a switch or link changes its status. Besides, it uses the sFlow standard, which is supported by all switches, to quickly detect flows emerging or existing in the network and accurately estimate their current bandwidth usages in real time.  
* **Use a digital-twin-powered simulation platform to quickly find the optimal solution to the current or forthcoming problem**: NDTwin provides a general-purpose simulation platform where different-purpose simulator programs can be installed and invoked on-demand to simulate many what-if conditions in parallel. Based on the digital-twin-powered simulation results, NDTwin applications can quickly find the optimal solution to the current problem or a forthcoming problem that they are designed to handle. 
* **Employ a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller to real-time control a network based on the digital-twin-found optimal solution**: NDTwin can operate a network composed of switches that support the OpenFlow protocol. It uses an SDN controller (e.g., Ryu) to real-time control the network based on the optimal solution found by its digital-twin-powered applications.
* **Provide useful digital-twin-powered applications that optimally control a network**: NDTwin currently provides serveral useful applications that optimally control a network. The energy-saving application will automatically power off under-utilized switches when the network load drops below a low watermark threshold, thus greatly saving the energy consumption of a network without lowering its Quality of Service (QoS). The load-balancing application will dynamically adjust each Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) group's flow dispatching mapping, thus balancing the loads of the links of each ECMP group and significantly increasing the average link utilization of a network. More useful digital-twin-powered applications are being developed. 
* **Provide an open source development platform for any one to develop innovative digital-twin-powered applicatons**: NDTwin is open source. Its kernel provides a useful and rich set of API functions for any one to develop innovative digital-twin-powered applications.  
* **Provide a Web GUI tool (WGT) and real-time network traffic visualizer (NTV)**: NDTwin provides an easy-to-use Web GUI tool by which the user no longer needs to use Command Line Interface (CLI) to issue network commands, read network settings, or debug network problems. NDTwin also provides a real-time network traffic visualizer (NTV) by which the user can real-time "see" where current flows exist in the network, what routing paths they are taking, and their relative current bandwidth usages.  
* **Work correctly for both physical networks and emulated networks**: NDTwin has been rigorously tested and verified that it works correctly for physical networks composed of tens of hardware switches (Brocade and HPE) and hundreds of hosts using fat-tree-like network topologies. Besides, NDTwin has been rigorously tested and verified that it works correctly for Mininet-emulated networks.
* **Provide a large language model (LLM)-powered intent-based network management interface**: NDTwin employs LLMs to support intent-based network management. From its Web GUI tool, NDTwin users can use natural language to easily ask NDTwin to retrieve real-time information about a network or request NDTwin to carry out their desired operations.   
* **Provide a network traffic generation (NTG) framework by which a very large number of flows can be automatically generated and launched without any human efforts**: NDTwin provides a powerful network traffic generation framework by which hundreds or thousands of UDP or TCP flows can be automatically generated and launched over time without human efforts among the hosts of a network (which can be either a physical network or a Mininet-emulated network). The characteristics of generated network traffic can be easily set and varied according to a configuration file in which flow size, flow duration, flow protocol, flow sending rate, and other important parameters can be set. This NTG framework is very useful for testing the functions and evaluating the real-life performance of an NDTwin application under development. 
* **Provide a network state recorder (NSR) that records all network states during a specified interval**: NDTwin provides a network state recorder, which can be enabled or disabled as desired to record the states of all network switches and flows during that interval and save the recorded states into files. The Web GUI tool and network traffic visualizer can open these NSR files to replay the activities of the network occurring during the recording interval. This capability is very useful for checking, debugging, and analyzing the behavior of the network and the function of a new NDTwin application under development. 
* **Is being actively developed and maintained**: NDTwin is being actively developed and maintained. More useful digital-twin-powered applications will be added in the future. Besides, its functions, performance, and quality will be continuously enhanced.
