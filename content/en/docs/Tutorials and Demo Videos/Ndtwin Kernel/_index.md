# NDTwin Kernel

The **NDTwin Kernel** is the central nervous system of the Network Digital Twin framework. It is responsible for synchronizing the state between the physical network and the digital twin, managing data flow, and orchestrating interactions between NDT Applications (Apps) and the Simulation Server.

This guide details the kernel's execution lifecycle, internal modules, and key operational flows.
